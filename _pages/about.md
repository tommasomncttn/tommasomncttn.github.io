Hey! I’m Tommaso, currently doing a *Master’s in Data Science* at **EPFL**.  
Between lectures and problem sets, I spend my time at **GLADIA** working on *LLMs*, mainly figuring out how to make them more *interpretable* and *safer*.

My academic path is a bit unconventional: I hold a *BSc in AI and Mathematics* and a *BA in Philosophy*. That means I probably know more math than most philosophers, more computer science than most mathematicians, and more philosophy than most computer scientists. Not entirely sure if that’s a strength or just confusing — but it definitely keeps things interesting.
